- [ ] September 23: A brief summary of three papers (what is the paper about? What are the assumptions in the paper? What is the solution approach? How is this relevant to your work?)  

- [ ] September 30: A brief summary of the EDA effort on the data and/ or a summary of three more relevant papers and any refinement to the assumptions on the data, solution or evaluation strategy and division of tasks – who will be responsible for what? (for the upcoming weeks)
